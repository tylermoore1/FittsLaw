        <h3> Our Experiment </h3>
        <p> When people are using a computer, they tend to use the trackpad instead of
        an actual mouse when they are pointing to stuff on the screen. So our thought
        process was to do an experiment to see if the index finger or middle finger was
        more efficient at moving across the screen. So for the actual experiment, we had two
        people test out their index and middle fingers. First, both people tested out their index
        finger at the same time and did multiple trials. Then we averaged the results to find the
        average speed for people using their index finger. After that, we did the same approach
        for two people using their middle finger. </p>
